   abstract = {[1] Mantle density heterogeneities, imaged using seismic tomography, contain information about timedependent mantle flow and mantle structures that existed in the past. We model the history of mantle flow using a tomographic image of the mantle beneath southern Africa as an initial condition while reversing the direction of flow and analytically incorporating cooling plates as a boundary condition. If the resulting (backwards integrated) model for structures is used as a starting point for a forwards convection model, today's mantle can be adequately reconstructed if we do not integrate backwards more than than about 50-75 Ma. Flow can also be reliably reversed through the Mesozoic, but only if instability of the lower boundary layer can be suppressed. Our model predicts that the large seismically-slow and presumably hot structure beneath southern Africa produced 500-700 m of dynamic topography throughout the Cenozoic. Since ̃30 Ma, uplift has moved from eastern to southern Africa, where uplift rates are ̃10 m/Myr, consistent with observations. During the Mesozoic, the modeled topographic high is situated near Gondwanaland rifting, raising the possibility that this buoyant structure may have been involved with this breakup. © 2003 by the American Geophysical Union.},

The growth model is a reaction-diffusion partial differential equation (PDE) for the tumor concentration. We use a PDE-constrained optimization formulation for the inverse problem. The unknown parameters are the reaction coefficient (proliferation), the diffusion coefficient (infiltration), and the initial condition field for the tumor PDE. Segmentation of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scans drive the inverse problem where segmented tumor regions serve as partial observations of the tumor concentration. Like most cases in clinical practice, we use data from a single time snapshot. Moreover, the precise time relative to the initiation of the tumor is unknown, which poses an additional difficulty for inversion. We perform a frozen-coefficient spectral analysis and show that the inverse problem is severely ill-posed. We introduce a biophysically motivated regularization on the structure and magnitude of the tumor initial condition. In particular, we assume that the tumor starts at a few locations (enforced with a sparsity constraint on the initial condition of the tumor) and that the initial condition magnitude in the maximum norm is equal to one. We solve the resulting optimization problem using an inexact quasi-Newton method combined with a compressive sampling algorithm for the sparsity constraint. Our implementation uses PETSc and AccFFT libraries. We conduct numerical experiments on synthetic and clinical images to highlight the improved performance of our solver over a previously existing solver that uses standard two-norm regularization for the calibration parameters. The existing solver is unable to localize the initial condition. Our new solver can localize the initial condition and recover infiltration and proliferation. In clinical datasets (for which the ground truth is unknown), our solver results in qualitatively different solutions compared to the two-norm regularized solver.},

journal = {Reports on Progress in Physics},
abstract = {This article introduces and reviews recent work using a simple optimization technique for analysing the nonlinear stability of a state in a dynamical system. The technique can be used to identify the most efficient way to disturb a system such that it transits from one stable state to another. The key idea is introduced within the framework of a finite-dimensional set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs) and then illustrated for a very simple system of two ODEs which possesses bistability. Then the transition to turbulence problem in fluid mechanics is used to show how the technique can be formulated for a spatially-extended system described by a set of partial differential equations (the well-known Navier–Stokes equations). Within that context, the optimization technique bridges the gap between (linear) optimal perturbation theory and the (nonlinear) dynamical systems approach to fluid flows. The fact that the technique has now been recently shown to work in this very high dimensional setting augurs well for its utility in other physical systems.}

@article{Mannix2022-dynamo,
   abstract = {We demonstrate that the nonlinear optimisation of a finite-amplitude disturbance over a freely evolving and possibly even turbulent flow, can successfully identify subcritical dynamo branches as well as the structure and amplitude of their critical perturbations. As this approach does not require prior knowledge of the magnetic field amplification mechanisms, it opens a new avenue for systematically probing subcritical dynamo flows. Long-lived astrophysical magnetic fields display a remarkable diversity of spatial scales, structures and intensities-with detected fields of order ∼ 1µG in galaxies [1], to ∼ 10 14 G in magnetars [2]. A century ago, Joseph Larmor argued that intense magnetic fields can be born out of a dynamo instability [3], whereby favorable flow motions amplify a magnetic seed field in the electrically conducting fluid layers of celestial bodies. Ever since, the origin of astrophysical magnetic fields has continued to raise many fundamental questions. Indeed, exhibiting a flow capable of amplifying and maintaining a magnetic field by dynamo action has proved a challenging task, both from a theoretical and experimental point of view [4] : firstly, fluid motions need to be vigorous enough, and the fluid resistivity sufficiently low, for induction to overcome the destructive effect of ohmic dissipation. As a result, igniting a dynamo instability out of a weak magnetic seed, often translates into intractable parameter regimes for global numerical simulations or unsustainable energy costs for laboratory devices, so that experimental dynamos are very scarce, whether in liquid metals [5-7] or plasma flows [8, 9]. Secondly , flows too simple-in the sense that they present too many symmetries, such as (typically) Keplerian flows-are linearly stable to dynamo action [10]. In some situations however, a dynamo can be triggered by finite-amplitude disturbances even in a highly symmetric or (comparatively) poorly conducting flow. This springs from the nonlinear nature of the magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) equations, and can occur whenever the feedback of the magnetic field on the flow, sustains its own amplification by sub-critical dynamo instability. Natural systems where subcriti-cal dynamos are assumed to operate abound, with important examples including the Earth's core [11], but also accretion disks and radiative stars [12, 13], where magnetogenesis is poorly understood despite its suspected role in explaining the observed anomalous transport of angular momentum [14, 15]. Due to the lack of a systematic nonlinear stability method however, the identification and modeling of subcritical dynamos so far involves a substantial amount of luck. Successful attempts have relied on imposing (and subsequently removing) a specifically tailored electromotive force or magnetic field [12, 16]. This however, requires some prior knowledge of the field's structure and the intensity required to sustain a dynamo in a given flow. Another way is identifying a dynamo branch as it linearly bifurcates from the base state, and then following the branch backwards in parameter space, below its linear instability threshold-a method however doomed to fail when the threshold parameter regime is intractable, or when the base state is always linearly stable to dynamo instability. In this Letter, we show how subcritical dynamo branches can be systematically explored in a given MHD base flow. Furthermore, we aim at determining the minimal dynamo seed-that is, the spatial structure of the smallest-amplitude (and often low dimensional) magnetic disturbance, capable of non-linearly triggering a self-sustaining dynamo in a given system. Our approach builds on the mathematical tools of optimal control and nonmodal stability analysis [17], which have recently been used in the context of subcritical transition to hydrody-namic turbulence in shear flows [18-20]. The robustness of the proposed method is demonstrated by considering two contrasting reference flows-namely, a local model of laminar quasi-Keplerian Couette flow , and a turbulent Taylor-Green flow. To that end, we consider the MHD system: ∂ u ∂t + (u · ∇)u − νu + ∇P − (∇ × b) × b = 0, (1) ∂ b ∂t − ∇ × u × b − ηb = 0, (2) ∇ · u = 0, (3) ∇ · b = 0, (4) where u(x,t), b(x,t) and P(x,t) are respectively the velocity, magnetic and pressure fields; ν is the kinematic viscosity and η the magnetic diffusivity. Here the magnetic field is rescaled by 1/ √ ρ µ 0 as an Alfvèn velocity, where ρ is the (constant) fluid density and µ 0 the void magnetic permeability. At long times, any initial condition b 0 = b(x, 0) capable of nonlinearly exciting a dynamo instability, will yield strong amplification of the magnetic energy. We thus consider the following question: given a reference flow u 0 = u(x, 0), and an initial magnetic energy density budget M 0 = |b 0 | 2 (where f = 1 V V f dV denotes spatial average), what initial condition b 0 maximises the objective function J(b 0) = T 0 |b| 2 dt by some target time T ? Maximisation of the magnetic energy has been previously used to optimize a frozen velocity field in the (linear) kinematic dynamo problem [21-24]. Here we address the optimisation question by extremising the},

   abstract = {We develop and study an adjoint-based inversion method for the simultaneous recovery of initial temperature conditions and viscosity parameters in time-dependent mantle convection from the current mantle temperature and historic plate motion. Based on a realistic rheological model with temperature-dependent and strain-rate-dependent viscosity, we formulate the inversion as a PDE-constrained optimization problem. The objective functional includes the misfit of surface velocity (plate motion) history, the misfit of the current mantle temperature, and a regularization for the uncertain initial condition. The gradient of this functional with respect to the initial temperature and the uncertain viscosity parameters is computed by solving the adjoint of the mantle convection equations. This gradient is used in a preconditioned quasi-Newton minimization algorithm. We study the prospects and limitations of the inversion, as well as the computational performance of the method using two synthetic problems, a sinking cylinder and a realistic subduction model. The subduction model is characterized by the migration of a ridge toward a trench whereby both plate motions and subduction evolve. The results demonstrate: (1) for known viscosity parameters, the initial temperature can be well recovered, as in previous initial condition-only inversions where the effective viscosity was given; (2) for known initial temperature, viscosity parameters can be recovered accurately, despite the existence of trade-offs due to ill-conditioning; (3) for the joint inversion of initial condition and viscosity parameters, initial condition and effective viscosity can be reasonably recovered, but the high dimension of the parameter space and the resulting ill-posedness may limit recovery of viscosity parameters.},

   abstract = {Through the assimilation of present-day mantle seismic structure, adjoint methods can be used to constrain the structure of the mantle at earlier times, i.e., mantle initial conditions. However, the application to geophysical problems is restricted through both the high computational expense from repeated iteration between forward and adjoint models and the need to know mantle properties (such as viscosity and the absolute magnitude of temperature or density) a priori.We propose that an optimal first guess to the initial condition can be obtained through a simple backward integration (SBI) of the governing equations, thus lessening the computational expense. Given a model with known mantle properties, we show that a solution based on an SBI-generated first guess has smaller residuals than arbitrary guesses. Mantle viscosity and the effective Rayleigh number are crucial for mantle convection models, neither of which is exactly known. We place additional constraints on these basic mantle properties when the convection- induced dynamic topography on Earth’s surface is considered within an adjoint inverse method. Besides assimilating present-day seismic structure as a constraint, we use dynamic topography and its rate of change in an inverse method that allows simultaneous inversion of the absolute upper and lower mantle viscosities, scaling between seismic velocity and thermal anomalies, and initial condition. The theory is derived from the governing equations of mantle convection and validated by synthetic experiments for both one-layer viscosity and two-layer viscosity regionally bounded spherical shells. For the one-layer model, at any instant of time, the magnitude of dynamic topography is controlled by the temperature scaling while the rate of change of topography is controlled by the absolute value of viscosity. For the two-layer case, the rate of change of topography constrains upper mantle viscosity while the magnitude of dynamic topography determines the temperature scaling (lower mantle viscosity) when upper-mantle (lower-mantle) density anomaly dominates the flow field; this two-stage scheme minimizes the tradeoff between temperature and lower mantle viscosity. For both cases, we show that the theory can constrain mantle properties with errors arising through the adjoint recovery of the initial condition; for the two-layer model, this error is manifest as a tradeoff between the temperature scaling and lower mantle viscosity},

   abstract = {We present a comprehensive study of the statistical features of a three-dimensional (3D) time-reversible truncated Navier-Stokes (RNS) system, wherein the standard viscosity ν is replaced by a fluctuating thermostat that dynamically compensates for fluctuations in the total energy. We analyze the statistical features of the RNS steady states in terms of a non-negative dimensionless control parameter Rr, which quantifies the balance between the fluctuations of kinetic energy at the forcing length scale ℓf and the total energy E0. For small Rr, the RNS equations are found to produce "warm" stationary statistics, e.g., characterized by the partial thermalization of the small scales. For large Rr, the stationary solutions have features akin to standard hydrodynamic ones: they have compact energy support in k space and are essentially insensitive to the truncation scale kmax. The transition between the two statistical regimes is observed to be smooth but rather sharp. Using insights from a diffusion model of turbulence (Leith model), we argue that the transition is in fact akin to a continuous second-order phase transition, where Rr indeed behaves as a thermodynamic control parameter, e.g., a temperature. A relevant order parameter can be suitably defined in terms of a (normalized) enstrophy, while the symmetry-breaking parameter h is identified as (one over) the truncation scale kmax. We find that the signatures of the phase transition close to the critical point Rr can essentially be deduced from a heuristic mean-field Landau free energy. This point of view allows us to reinterpret the relevant asymptotics in which the dynamical ensemble equivalence conjectured by Gallavotti [Phys. Lett. A 223, 91 (1996)PYLAAG0375-960110.1016/S0375-9601(96)00729-3] could hold true. We argue that Gallavotti's limit is precisely the joint limit Rr→>Rr and h→>0, with the overset symbol ">" indicating that those limits are approached from above. The limit therefore relates to the statistical features at the critical point. In this regime, our numerics indicate that the low-order statistics of the 3D RNS are indeed qualitatively similar to those observed in direct numerical simulations of the standard Navier-Stokes equations with viscosity chosen so as to match the average value of the reversible thermostat. This result suggests that Gallavotti's equivalence conjecture could indeed be of relevance to model 3D turbulent statistics, and provides a clear guideline for further numerical investigations involving higher resolutions.},

   abstract = {Among existing subgrid scale (SGS) models for large-eddy simulation (LES), some are time reversible in the sense that the dynamics evolve backward in time after a transformation u → −u at every point in space. In practice, reversible subgrid models reduce the numerical stability of the simulations since the effect of the subgrid scales is no longer strictly dissipative. This lack of stability constitutes often a criterion to reject this kind of models. The aim of this paper is to examine whether time-reversibility can constitute a criterion that a subgrid model has to fulfill, or has not to. Thereto, we investigate by direct numerical simulation (DNS) the time dependence of the kinetic energy of the resolved scales when the velocity is reversed in all or part of the length scales of the turbulent flow. These results are compared with results from existing LES subgrid models. It is argued that the criterion of time reversibility to assess subgrid models is incompatible with the main underlying assumption of LES. 1. Introduction The complexity of turbulence is due to a wide range of nonlinearly interacting scales. The numerical simulation of a turbulent flow, in most practical applications, cannot take into account the full range of scales due to limitations in computational resources. The principle of large-eddy simulation (LES) is that only the large scales are computed directly. The influence of the scales smaller than a given scale, associated to the grid mesh of the simulation, are modeled as a function of the resolved scales. To develop consistent subgrid scale (SGS) models, criteria are needed, based on physical or mathemathical principles and sometimes on the numerical stability of the closed set of equations. It is important that these criteria are well defined and generally accepted. The last two decades have seen the emergence of a large number of new subgrid models, and it is the authors' opinion that the turbulence community must devote more efforts in developing consensual criteria than in increasing the number of models. The purpose of the present work is to investigate one possible criterion, which is the time reversibility of a subgrid model when the orientation of the velocity is inversed, i.e., under the transformation u → −u. We report the results of direct numerical simulations (DNS) in which the velocity is reversed in all, or part, of the scales of the flow.

This paper details the numerical method that enables this translation, describes the design and implementation of the codebase, and illustrates its capabilities with a variety of example problems. The numerical method is a first-order generalized tau formulation that discretizes equations into banded matrices. This method is implemented with an object-oriented design. Classes for spectral bases and domains manage the discretization and automatic parallel distribution of variables. Discretized fields and mathematical operators are symbolically manipulated with a basic computer algebra system. Initial value, boundary value, and eigenvalue problems are efficiently solved using high-performance linear algebra, transform, and parallel communication libraries.

The performance of the code is evaluated with a parallel scaling benchmark and a comparison to a finite-volume code. The features and flexibility of the codebase are illustrated by solving several examples: The nonlinear Schrödinger equation on a graph, a supersonic magnetohydrodynamic vortex, quasigeostrophic flow, Stokes flow in a cylindrical annulus, normal modes of a radiative atmosphere, and diamagnetic levitation.},

   abstract = {This paper considers solution strategies for dynamical inverse problems, where the main goal is to determine the excitation of a dynamical system, such that some output variables, which are derived from the system's state variables, coincide with desired time functions. The paper demonstrates how such problems can be restated as optimal control problems and presents a numerical solution approach based on the method of steepest descent. First, a performance measure is introduced, which characterizes the deviation of the output variables from the desired values, and which is minimized by the solution of the inverse problem. Second, we show, how the gradient of this error functional can be computed efficiently by applying the theory of optimal control, in particular by following an idea of Kelley and Bryson. As the major contribution of this paper we present a modification of this method which allows the application to the case where the state equations are given by a set of differential algebraic equations. This situation has great practical importance since multibody systems are mostly described in this way. For comparison, we also discuss an approach which bases an a direct transcription of the optimal control problem. Moreover, other methods to solve dynamical inverse problems are summarized. © 2012 American Society of Mechanical Engineers.},

   abstract = {The non-linear evolution of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability is a popular test for code verification. To date, most Kelvin-Helmholtz problems discussed in the literature are ill-posed: they do not converge to any single solution with increasing resolution. This precludes comparisons among different codes and severely limits the utility of the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability as a test problem. The lack of a reference solution has led various authors to assert the accuracy of their simulations based on ad hoc proxies, e.g. the existence of small-scale structures. This paper proposes well-posed two-dimensional Kelvin-Helmholtz problems with smooth initial conditions and explicit diffusion.We show that in many cases numerical errors/noise can seed spurious small-scale structure in Kelvin-Helmholtz problems.We demonstrate convergence to a reference solution using both ATHENA, a Godunov code, and DEDALUS, a pseudo-spectral code. Problems with constant initial density throughout the domain are relatively straightforward for both codes. However, problems with an initial density jump (which are the norm in astrophysical systems) exhibit rich behaviour and are more computationally challenging. In the latter case, ATHENA simulations are prone to an instability of the inner rolled-up vortex; this instability is seeded by grid-scale errors introduced by the algorithm, and disappears as resolution increases. Both ATHENA and DEDALUS exhibit late-time chaos. Inviscid simulations are riddled with extremely vigorous secondary instabilities which induce more mixing than simulations with explicit diffusion. Our results highlight the importance of running well-posed test problems with demonstrated convergence to a reference solution. To facilitate future comparisons, we include as supplementary material the resolved, converged solutions to the Kelvin-Helmholtz problems in this paper in machine-readable form.},

   abstract = {Data assimilation leads naturally to a Bayesian formulation in which the posterior probability distribution of the system state, given all the observations on a time window of interest, plays a central conceptual role. The aim of this paper is to use this Bayesian posterior probability distribution as a gold standard against which to evaluate various commonly used data assimilation algorithms. A key aspect of geophysical data assimilation is the high dimensionality and limited predictability of the computational model. This paper examines the two-dimensional Navier-Stokes equations in a periodic geometry, which has these features and yet is tractable for explicit and accurate computation of the posterior distribution by state-of-the-art statistical sampling techniques. The commonly used algorithms that are evaluated, as quantified by the relative error in reproducing moments of the posterior, are four-dimensional variational data assimilation (4DVAR) and a variety of sequential filtering approximations based on threedimensional variational data assimilation (3DVAR) and on extended and ensemble Kalman filters. The primary conclusions are that, under the assumption of a well-defined posterior probability distribution, (i) with appropriate parameter choices, approximate filters can perform well in reproducing the mean of the desired probability distribution, (ii) they do not perform as well in reproducing the covariance, and (iii) the error is compounded by the need to modify the covariance, in order to induce stability. Thus, filters can be a useful tool in predicting mean behavior but should be viewed with caution as predictors of uncertainty. These conclusions are intrinsic to the algorithms when assumptions underlying them are not valid and will not change if the model complexity is increased. ©2012 American Meteorological Society.},

The method is based on minimizing a functional (of the initial condition and the period) that is positive unless the solution is periodic, in which case it is zero.We solve an adjoint PDE to compute the gradient of this functional with respect to the initial condition. We include additional terms in the functional to specify the free parameters, which in the case of the Benjamin-Ono equation, are the mean, a spatial phase, a temporal phase, and the real part of one of the Fourier modes at t = 0. We use our method to study global paths of nontrivial time-periodic solutions connecting stationary and traveling waves of the Benjamin-Ono equation. As a starting guess for each path, we compute periodic solutions of the linearized problem by solving an infinite dimensional eigenvalue problem in closed form. We then use our numerical method to continue these solutions beyond the realm of linear theory until another traveling wave is reached. By experimentation with data fitting, we identify the analytical form of the solutions on the path connecting the one-hump stationary solution to the two-hump traveling wave. We then derive exact formulas for these solutions by explicitly solving the system of ODEs governing the evolution of solitons using the ansatz suggested by the numerical simulations.},

This cost is substantially less than that of DAL, which requires O(10) direct-adjoint loops to converge.

Computationally more efficient alternatives are Quasi-Newton methods, where the repeated computation of the Jacobian is replaced by an approximate update, but unfortunately are often too restrictive for highly ill-posed problems. To overcome this limitation, we present a highly efficient data-driven Quasi-Newton method applicable to nonlinear inverse problems, by using the singular value decomposition and learning a mapping from model outputs to the singular values to compute the updated Jacobian.

We provide expressions for the gradient of the cost functional of this optimization problem with respect to two spatially-varying rheological parameter fields: the viscosity prefactor and the exponent of the second invariant of the strain rate tensor. Adjoint (linearized) Stokes equations, which are characterized by a 4th order anisotropic viscosity tensor, facilitates efficient computation of the gradient. A quasi-Newton method for the solution of this optimization problem is presented, which requires the repeated solution of both nonlinear forward Stokes and linearized adjoint Stokes equations. For the solution of the nonlinear Stokes equations, we find that Newton’s method is significantly more efficient than a Picard fixed point method. Spectral analysis of the inverse operator given by the Hessian of the optimization problem reveals that the numerical eigenvalues collapse rapidly to zero, suggesting a high degree of ill-posedness of the inverse problem. To overcome this ill-posedness, we employ Tikhonov regularization (favoring smooth parameter fields) or total variation (TV) regularization (favoring piecewise-smooth parameter fields). Solution of two- and three-dimensional finite element-based model inverse problems show that a constant parameter in the constitutive law can be recovered well from surface velocity observations. Inverting for a spatially-varying parameter field leads to its reasonable recovery, in particular close to the surface. When inferring two spatially varying parameter fields, only an effective viscosity field and the total viscous dissipation are recoverable. Finally, a model of a subducting plate shows that a localized weak zone at the plate boundary can be partially recovered, especially with TV regularization.},

	abstract = {Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) have recently become a popular method for solving forward and inverse problems governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). By incorporating the residual of the PDE into the loss function of a neural network-based surrogate model for the unknown state, PINNs can seamlessly blend measurement data with physical constraints. Here, we extend this framework to PDE-constrained optimal control problems, for which the governing PDE is fully known and the goal is to find a control variable that minimizes a desired cost objective. We provide a set of guidelines for obtaining a good optimal control solution; first by selecting an appropriate PINN architecture and training parameters based on a forward problem, second by choosing the best value for a critical scalar weight in the loss function using a simple but effective two-step line search strategy. We then validate the performance of the PINN framework by comparing it to adjoint-based nonlinear optimal control, which performs gradient descent on the discretized control variable while satisfying the discretized PDE. This comparison is carried out on several distributed control examples based on the Laplace, Burgers, Kuramoto-Sivashinsky, and Navier-Stokes equations. Finally, we discuss the advantages and caveats of using the PINN and adjoint-based approaches for solving optimal control problems constrained by nonlinear PDEs.},

	abstract = {This study demonstrates how the adjoint-based framework traditionally used to compute gradients in PDE optimization problems can be extended to handle general constraints on the state variables. This is accomplished by constructing a projection of the gradient of the objective functional onto a subspace tangent to the manifold defined by the constraint. This projection is realized by solving an adjoint problem defined in terms of the same adjoint operator as used in the system employed to determine the gradient, but with a different forcing. We focus on the "optimize-then-discretize" paradigm in the infinite-dimensional setting where the required regularity of both the gradient and of the projection is ensured. The proposed approach is illustrated with two examples: a simple test problem describing optimization of heat transfer in one direction and a more involved problem where an optimal closure is found for a turbulent flow described by the Navier-Stokes system in two dimensions, both considered subject to different state constraints. The accuracy of the gradients and projections computed by solving suitable adjoint systems is carefully verified and the presented computational results show that the solutions of the optimization problems obtained with the proposed approach satisfy the state constraints with a good accuracy, although not exactly.},
